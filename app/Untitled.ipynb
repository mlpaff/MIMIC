She felt dizzy and had diplopia.  She\\nfell the day prior to admission and was brought back to bed\\nand could not get out of bed until the day of admission when\\nEMS was called.  She was brought to [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital\\nwhere a CT of her head showed left frontal hemorrhage and\\nright occipital hemorrhage.  Also a mass was detected on her\\nchest x-ray and confirmed by chest CT.  Patient was then\\ntransferred to [**Hospital1 69**].\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Lumbar diskectomy.  Hypertension.\\nDepression.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  None known.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.day, Univasc\\n30 mg q.day, thiamine 100 mg IM, MVI one p.o. q.day, Levaquin\\n500 mg IV q.24 hours, atenolol 75 mg p.o. q.a.m., Norvasc 10\\nmg p.o. q.day, folate 1 mg p.o. q.day, Tylenol and magnesium.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's heart rate was 46, blood\\npressure 158/51, SAO2 96 percent, respiratory rate 19.\\nPatient was awake, alert, slightly lethargic, oriented times\\ntwo.  Lungs were clear, left lung slightly coarse breath\\nsounds.  Abdomen soft, nontender.  Cardiac regular rate and\\nrhythm.  Extremities had no edema.  Neurologic exam showed an\\nawake, slightly lethargic, oriented times two, not to time,\\nslightly reversed when following commands.  Right eye had\\nslightly decreased adduction, slight decreased elevation of\\nthe right eye.  Also left lateral gaze nystagmus.  Face was\\nsymmetric.  Frontalis was intact.  Moderate dysarthria.  No\\nobvious drift.  Upper and lower extremities were full [**5-18**] for\\nmuscle.  Reflexes were 1+ in the upper extremities and 1 in\\nthe lower extremities.  No Hoffmann, no clonus.  Sensation\\nwas intact to lower extremities bilaterally.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.6, hematocrit 27.4,\\nplatelets 309.  INR 1.3, PTT 33.2.  Sodium 139, potassium\\n3.4, chloride 106, CO2 22.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The plan for this patient was admission to\\nthe ICU, obtain an MRI with gadolinium.  She was made NPO, IV\\nfluids at 80 an hour.  Neuro checks were q.one hour.  She was\\ngiven mannitol 25 q.four hours and Decadron 8 mg q.four\\nhours.  On [**8-13**] the patient was noted to be arousable,\\noriented to person only, very dysarthric, more lethargic than\\nthe previous day.  She had received Ativan at the time of\\nexamination.  She did have a slight right drift.  She had an\\nMRI which showed a large right cerebellar T2 hypointense and\\nT1 hyperintense mass which measured about 5 cm in maximal\\ndimension.  A DWI scan [**Month (only) 3780**] loss of signal in the\\nright cerebellum and left frontal lobe.  MR [**First Name (Titles) 4058**]\\n[**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] flow in both intracranial carotid arteries and\\nin the anterior middle cerebral artery.  There was flow in\\nthe vertebral arteries.  The impression was cerebellar and\\ncerebral hemorrhagic masses consistent with metastasis.  The\\ncerebellar mass is large and there is superior herniation\\ninto the cerebellum and compression of the fourth ventricle.\\n\\nGiven the patient's exam and MRI findings, it was felt that\\nthe patient should have an emergent craniotomy for removal of\\nthis tumor and the hemorrhagic lesion.  Prior to surgery\\npatient did have an interventional pulmonology consult.  They\\nsaw her and felt she had a left upper lobe mass infiltrate\\nwith the diagnosis that included possible pneumonia versus\\nlung mass versus combination.  They did follow her throughout\\nher stay here and did not recommend that she needed\\nbronchoscopy at this time.  They referred her to oncology.\\n\\nThe patient was brought to the O.R. on [**2144-8-13**] where she\\nunderwent craniotomy and removal of the right cerebellar\\nhemorrhagic lesion.  Patient did well intraoperatively and\\nhad no complications.  On post-op day one patient was awake,\\noriented times name only, inattentive, unable to follow\\nmidline commands.  She had abduction depression of the right\\neye.  Pupils were 5 to 3.5 in the right eye and left eye 4.5\\nto 2.5.  She had a question of bilateral slight pronator\\ndrift, greater on the right than the left.  Recommendations\\nwere to keep her blood pressure less than 150, use minimal\\nAtivan only and to slowly advance her diet.  Her post-op\\nhematocrit was 25.9.  Also on the 1st she had repeat MRI\\nwhich showed status post resection of right cerebellar\\nhemorrhagic lesion without residual enhancement.  Left\\nfrontal hemorrhagic lesion with enhancement was suggestive of\\nmetastatic disease.\\n\\nThe patient did require the use of Nipride to keep her\\nsystolic blood pressure less than 140.  She did have periods\\nof agitation at times.  On [**8-15**] patient was awake,\\ncontinued in the ICU.  Her face was symmetric.  No rebound,\\nno drift.  Finger to nose showed slight right dysmetria.\\nPatient was advanced out of bed to a chair.  Her activity was\\nalso increased.  Patient was continued on IV Decadron 4 mg\\nq.six hours.  In the late afternoon of the 2nd, patient was\\ntransferred out of the unit awake, alert and oriented times\\nthree, moving all extremities.  Vital signs were stable.  She\\ndid see physical therapy when moved to the floor who\\nrecommended that she receive visitations every day by them to\\nassist with her impaired mobility and help with her impaired\\nmental status.\\n\\nOn [**8-16**] the patient was awake, alert, oriented,\\ntolerating a diet, ambulating with help.  Her dysarthria was\\nnoted to be improved.  She had a slight right drift noted.\\nHer dysmetria was also improved.  Her Foley was removed.\\nDecadron was continued to be weaned.  Occupational therapy\\nalso saw her and assisted her with safety awareness and\\nhelped her with her upper extremities.  On the 5th oncology\\nsaw patient who felt that she most likely will receive\\npalliative chemotherapy with radiation rather than systemic\\nchemo.  Patient's special stains for melanoma were found to\\nbe negative on [**8-19**].  Patient will need to go to a rehab\\nfacility for further assistance with her gait and\\nrehabilitation needs.  She is to follow up in the brain tumor\\nclinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].  She also needs to follow up with\\nhematology/oncology here at [**Hospital1 188**].\\n\\nThe patient was treated with Levaquin for pneumonia that was\\ndiagnosed prior to admission.  She received 10 days of\\nLevaquin therapy.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  To keep the staples clean and dry,\\ndo not get them wet.  She should have them removed on\\n[**2144-8-26**].

She felt dizzy and had diplopia.  She\\nfell the day prior to admission and was brought back to bed\\nand could not get out of bed until the day of admission when\\nEMS was called.  She was brought to [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital\\nwhere a CT of her head showed left frontal hemorrhage and\\nright occipital hemorrhage.  Also a mass was detected on her\\nchest x-ray and confirmed by chest CT.  Patient was then\\ntransferred to [**Hospital1 69**].\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Lumbar diskectomy.  Hypertension.\\nDepression.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  None known.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.day, Univasc\\n30 mg q.day, thiamine 100 mg IM, MVI one p.o. q.day, Levaquin\\n500 mg IV q.24 hours, atenolol 75 mg p.o. q.a.m., Norvasc 10\\nmg p.o. q.day, folate 1 mg p.o. q.day, Tylenol and magnesium.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's heart rate was 46, blood\\npressure 158/51, SAO2 96 percent, respiratory rate 19.\\nPatient was awake, alert, slightly lethargic, oriented times\\ntwo.  Lungs were clear, left lung slightly coarse breath\\nsounds.  Abdomen soft, nontender.  Cardiac regular rate and\\nrhythm.  Extremities had no edema.  Neurologic exam showed an\\nawake, slightly lethargic, oriented times two, not to time,\\nslightly reversed when following commands.  Right eye had\\nslightly decreased adduction, slight decreased elevation of\\nthe right eye.  Also left lateral gaze nystagmus.  Face was\\nsymmetric.  Frontalis was intact.  Moderate dysarthria.  No\\nobvious drift.  Upper and lower extremities were full [**5-18**] for\\nmuscle.  Reflexes were 1+ in the upper extremities and 1 in\\nthe lower extremities.  No Hoffmann, no clonus.  Sensation\\nwas intact to lower extremities bilaterally.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.6, hematocrit 27.4,\\nplatelets 309.  INR 1.3, PTT 33.2.  Sodium 139, potassium\\n3.4, chloride 106, CO2 22.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The plan for this patient was admission to\\nthe ICU, obtain an MRI with gadolinium.  She was made NPO, IV\\nfluids at 80 an hour.  Neuro checks were q.one hour.  She was\\ngiven mannitol 25 q.four hours and Decadron 8 mg q.four\\nhours.  On [**8-13**] the patient was noted to be arousable,\\noriented to person only, very dysarthric, more lethargic than\\nthe previous day.  She had received Ativan at the time of\\nexamination.  She did have a slight right drift.  She had an\\nMRI which showed a large right cerebellar T2 hypointense and\\nT1 hyperintense mass which measured about 5 cm in maximal\\ndimension.  A DWI scan [**Month (only) 3780**] loss of signal in the\\nright cerebellum and left frontal lobe.  MR [**First Name (Titles) 4058**]\\n[**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] flow in both intracranial carotid arteries and\\nin the anterior middle cerebral artery.  There was flow in\\nthe vertebral arteries.  The impression was cerebellar and\\ncerebral hemorrhagic masses consistent with metastasis.  The\\ncerebellar mass is large and there is superior herniation\\ninto the cerebellum and compression of the fourth ventricle.\\n\\nGiven the patient's exam and MRI findings, it was felt that\\nthe patient should have an emergent craniotomy for removal of\\nthis tumor and the hemorrhagic lesion.  Prior to surgery\\npatient did have an interventional pulmonology consult.  They\\nsaw her and felt she had a left upper lobe mass infiltrate\\nwith the diagnosis that included possible pneumonia versus\\nlung mass versus combination.  They did follow her throughout\\nher stay here and did not recommend that she needed\\nbronchoscopy at this time.  They referred her to oncology.\\n\\nThe patient was brought to the O.R. on [**2144-8-13**] where she\\nunderwent craniotomy and removal of the right cerebellar\\nhemorrhagic lesion.  Patient did well intraoperatively and\\nhad no complications.  On post-op day one patient was awake,\\noriented times name only, inattentive, unable to follow\\nmidline commands.  She had abduction depression of the right\\neye.  Pupils were 5 to 3.5 in the right eye and left eye 4.5\\nto 2.5.  She had a question of bilateral slight pronator\\ndrift, greater on the right than the left.  Recommendations\\nwere to keep her blood pressure less than 150, use minimal\\nAtivan only and to slowly advance her diet.  Her post-op\\nhematocrit was 25.9.  Also on the 1st she had repeat MRI\\nwhich showed status post resection of right cerebellar\\nhemorrhagic lesion without residual enhancement.  Left\\nfrontal hemorrhagic lesion with enhancement was suggestive of\\nmetastatic disease.\\n\\nThe patient did require the use of Nipride to keep her\\nsystolic blood pressure less than 140.  She did have periods\\nof agitation at times.  On [**8-15**] patient was awake,\\ncontinued in the ICU.  Her face was symmetric.  No rebound,\\nno drift.  Finger to nose showed slight right dysmetria.\\nPatient was advanced out of bed to a chair.  Her activity was\\nalso increased.  Patient was continued on IV Decadron 4 mg\\nq.six hours.  In the late afternoon of the 2nd, patient was\\ntransferred out of the unit awake, alert and oriented times\\nthree, moving all extremities.  Vital signs were stable.  She\\ndid see physical therapy when moved to the floor who\\nrecommended that she receive visitations every day by them to\\nassist with her impaired mobility and help with her impaired\\nmental status.\\n\\nOn [**8-16**] the patient was awake, alert, oriented,\\ntolerating a diet, ambulating with help.  Her dysarthria was\\nnoted to be improved.  She had a slight right drift noted.\\nHer dysmetria was also improved.  Her Foley was removed.\\nDecadron was continued to be weaned.  Occupational therapy\\nalso saw her and assisted her with safety awareness and\\nhelped her with her upper extremities.  On the 5th oncology\\nsaw patient who felt that she most likely will receive\\npalliative chemotherapy with radiation rather than systemic\\nchemo.  Patient's special stains for melanoma were found to\\nbe negative on [**8-19**].  Patient will need to go to a rehab\\nfacility for further assistance with her gait and\\nrehabilitation needs.  She is to follow up in the brain tumor\\nclinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].  She also needs to follow up with\\nhematology/oncology here at [**Hospital1 188**].\\n\\nThe patient was treated with Levaquin for pneumonia that was\\ndiagnosed prior to admission.  She received 10 days of\\nLevaquin therapy.\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  To keep the staples clean and dry,\\ndo not get them wet.  She should have them removed on\\n[**2144-8-26**].  She can come back to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 to have those removed\\nor she can have them removed at her rehab facility.  Right\\nnow her appointment for the brain tumor clinic is pending.\\nAlso her appointment with oncology is pending at this time.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1.  Heparin 5000 units subcu.\\n2.
